* Corrected errors in inst/doc/index.html according to the error message of the W3C Markup Validator service.


  SAPP_1.0.3
 ===========
 * Set the correct dimension for array bounds (1) and (*) in eptrenf.f, etasimf.f, comsub.f, linsimf.f, aftpoi.f, pgraphf.f and simbvhf.f.

 * Add an argument "ier" to the subroutine linsimf and simbvhf.


  SAPP_1.0.2
 ===========
 * Fixed a bug in momori().
   In subroutine sizes, the size of the array "ti" in the declaration is unsuitable.

  (Reported by Brian Ripley)

 * Fixed a bug in pgraph().
   In subroutine palmpr, the size of the array "xx" in the declaration is unsuitable.

 * Add C wrapper functions to call Fortran subroutines.

 * Write to "tmpfile" in R function (eptren(), linlin(), etasap() and momori()) insted of in Fortran subroutine.
   Add "nlmax" to arguments of function eptren(), linlin(), etasap() and momori().


  SAPP_1.0.1
 ===========
 * Delete an extra line with the unterminated string at the end of the file SAPP/data/res2003JUL26.R.

 * Fixed a bug in eptren(). 
   In subroutine eptrenf, declare the dimension of array "amg".

 * Add an argument "kmax" to the subroutines linlinf, dav, linear, davidn, funct (linlinf.f) and comfac (comsub.f).
   In those subroutines, declare the dimension of array "lf" as the dynamic array lf(kmax,kmax).
