\details{
 The cyclic part is given by the Fourier series, the trend is given by usual polynomial.
The response functions of the self-exciting and the input are given by the Laguerre type polynomials (lgp), 
where the scaling parameters in the exponential function, say \eqn{c} and \eqn{d}, can be different. 
However it is advised to estimate \eqn{c} first without the input component, and then to estimate \eqn{d} with the fixed \eqn{c} 
(this means that the gradient corresponding to the \eqn{c} is set to keep \eqn{0}), which are good initial estimates for 
the \eqn{c} and \eqn{d} of the mixed self-exciting and input model.
 
 Note that estimated intensity sometimes happen to be negative on some part of time interval 
outside the neighborhood of events.  this take place more easily the larger the number of parameters. 
This causes some difficulty in getting the m.l.e., because the negativity of the intensity contributes to 
the seeming increase of the likelihood.

 Note that for the initial estimates of \eqn{ax(1)}, \eqn{ay(1)} and \eqn{at(1)}, some positive value are necessary. 
Especially 0.0 is not suitable.
